# NOVA SENTINEL NEURAL INTERFACE - LOGGING SPECIFICATIONS V2.1

Standard Log Format:
[TIMESTAMP: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ] [LOG_LEVEL] Message Text

Log Levels: INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, SYSTEM_ALERT

Security Note:
Unauthorized messages have been detected in the log stream. These messages appear to bypass standard formatting and are prefixed with [ATTACKER_MSG].

Analysis indicates these messages are encoded using a two-step process:

1. The original message is XORed with a secret key.
2. The result of the XOR operation is then encoded using Base64.

The secret key used for the XOR operation is suspected to be related to recent system alerts.

## Your Task

1. Identify the attackerâ€™s messages in the logs
5. Decode the encrypted flag done on TIMESTAMP: 3120-05-20T14:31:00Z
6. Recover the hidden flag in the format: `NYP{...}`.
