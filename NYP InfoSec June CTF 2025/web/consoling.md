## Solution
- Website has 3 buttons, only "PAGE WITH THE REAL FLAG" leads us to the right website, the other 2 are misleading
- This is the page upon clicking

- Based on the clue, we realise that we need to inspect the website 
- Source Code as shown hints at the function we have to use, and the flag could be hidden in "script.js" or "trash.js"
- Source code also hints that encryption is involved

- "listfunctions()" also gives us different commands

- Using the commands, we can find the encrypted string and the key

- Input AES Decryption script to reveal flag
    var encrypted = "U2FsdGVkX1/+BlAURUP5Pk6eQ6vCjySgoCCE/ZJyDESLlrlqfy5ibbzAVg+pdjPH";
    var passkey = "98D2B27"; // your passkey
    var decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encrypted, passkey).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
    console.log(decrypted);


### Flag
