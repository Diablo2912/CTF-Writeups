## Solution

- There are 2 outlets shown here **Burger King** and **О`КЕЙ**
- Since Burger King has many international outlets, it would not be wise to use Burger King as a landmark
- Search for "О`КЕЙ" logo on Google, which is a store in Russia 
- Searched the street name "Balkanskaya Ploshchad" on Google Maps 
- From the street, we can find the nearest train station, which is "Kupchino"
