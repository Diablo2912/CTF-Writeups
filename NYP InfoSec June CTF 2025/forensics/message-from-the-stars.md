## Solution
- From a quick analysis of the file, we find out his most visited website is **Transient Luminous Events â€“ Backyardastronomy.net**

- We can also find the last time he went to his most visited website. Do note that the time is in WebKit timestamps and needs to be converted to human-readable

- After conversion, we know the time is **31/05/2025/17:57:55**; however, the flag uses 12 12-hour clock, so it becomes **31/05/2025/5:57:55PM**
- The file also shows that he visited 3 laptop support websites. We can therefore understand that his laptop has to be one of the manufacturers and we can guess it

- Upon guessing, we find out that Lenovo is the correct match
