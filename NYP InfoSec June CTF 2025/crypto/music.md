## Challenge Description
There is a place I wanna visit for inspiration to continue!

[Download challenge.txt](https://github.com/Diablo2912/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/NYP%20InfoSec%20June%20CTF%202025/.files/challenge.txt)

## Solution

- The .txt file only has the words "Sword" and "Shield" suggesting a binary realtion
- Created [music.py](https://github.com/Diablo2912/CTF-Writeups/blob/main/NYP%20InfoSec%20June%20CTF%202025/.files/music.py) to convert Sword = "0" and Shield to "1". The script will also convert the binary into text format
- Run the script and flag can be derived
